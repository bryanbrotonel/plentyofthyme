  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The Metro Vancouver area has a problem with food waste and that is mainly
      caused by the lack of awareness surrounding this issue. People are unaware
      of the impact food waste has on our environment and the amount of money they
      could be saving.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Why Use Plenty of Thyme?</h3>
      <div>
    <p>Plenty of Thyme is a web based grocery application that will keep track of
    the items in your fridge as well as their expiry dates.</p>
    <p>Under the weekly view, a bi-weekly calendar will display the items expiring in the next two weeks,
      which acts as a convenient reminder. You are able to input the grocery item, its price,
      and its given expiry date--if a date is not given you are able to refer to our 'food guide' chart.
      You will have the option of deleting items manually or default it to delete itself once it has hit
      the expiry date. The application will take this information in for a period of time and provide a statistic of
      how much food and money you have wasted.</p>
